If you are using the code in any of your publication or part of another package please refer to:

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Joint Past Present (JPP)  decompositon for Topic Discovery.
An demo example of how to use the MATLAB functions is given in the demo.m using the TDT2 public data set (http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/tdt/tdt98/index.htm).
So, just run matlab, and run 'demo.m' script ;-)
